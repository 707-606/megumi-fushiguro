        <!-- Abilities/Powers -->

            <h2>Abilities</h2>


            <p><strong><em>Overall Skill Level:</em></strong><br>
                Megumi entered Jujutsu High as a Grade 2 sorcerer and is considered to have high potential by <i>Noritoshi Kamo, Mai Zenin, Satoru Gojo and even Sukuna.</i> <br>
               <br>The King of Curses notes that Megumi's willingness to use hand-to-hand combat makes him different from other shikigami users, as he is able to use his physical attacks in combination with his shikigami to entrap his opponent.
            </p>
            <p>According to Satoru, Megumi has equal or even more potential and skill than Yuji and later implies that Megumi could even be on par with Gojo himself someday.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Enhanced Strength:</em></strong><br>
                While not as strong as Yuji, Megumi has been shown to possess a high level of physical proficiency, and when he was in junior high, he beat up half the delinquents in the area.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Enhanced Speed:</em></strong><br>
                Although not as naturally fast as Yuji and Maki, he has been shown being able to follow their moves and fight alongside them effectively.
            </p>

            <p><strong><em></em>Enhanced Durability: </strong><br>
                Fushiguro has a large amount of durability. He has been shown to take hits from Sukuna at three fingers and from Aoi Todo and survive. He has survived a blow from a Finger Bearer and later won against it. <br>
               <br>After the Shibuya incident, Megumi was able to withstand forty units of G-force while fighting Reggie Star, whereas a normal person would lose consciousness at five to six units of G-force.
            </p>

            <p><strong><em>Enhanced Endurance:</em></strong><br>
                Fushiguro has unnatural endurance. He is able to constantly use Domain Expansion despite it pushing him to his limit. He was able to engage in a Domain tug-of-war with <i>Dagon</i> for an extended period of time, and continue fighting with <i>Toji</i> after that, even taking a stab wound and continue fighting and still be able to summon <i>Mahoraga.</i>
            </p>

            <p><strong><em>Enhanced Reflexes:</em></strong><br>
                Fushiguro has considerably better reflexes than others. He was able to react to Awasaka's attacks, dodge <i>Noritoshi Kamo's</i> arrows and even managed to react to Toji's attacks despite not being able to see him.
            </p>

            <p><strong><em>Weapon Mastery:</em></strong><br>
                Although Megumi's technique makes it difficult for him to wield weapons at the same time, as his shikigami need both hands to be summoned, he has started to train with polearms under Maki Zenin. <br>
             <br>He also once used tonfa to confront Noritoshi Kamo. He often used a jet-black sword, which he was quite skilled with, until it shattered.
            </p>

            <p><strong><em>Great Tactical Intellect: </em></strong><br>
                Megumi has showcased a <strong><em>high level </em></strong>of tactical thinking. He is capable of quickly spotting various weaknesses his opponents may have, being the person to recognize <i>Hanami's</i> branches as his weak spot. Megumi is also capable of determining cursed techniques his opponents may have, shown during the fight him and Yuji had against <i>Jiro Awasaka.</i>
            </p>
